# Image-Compression-using-K-means
compress image to 16 colors based on Scratched K-means Clustering. 

## why K-mens clustering:
 group unlabeled data into clusters for some business purpose ? </br>

## How k means clustering work:

assume:
we have data has 2 features x1, x2 , represented in x and y axis. </br>
and need to group these points into 3 clusters, so we: </br></br>

* randomly taking 3 points values for initialize centroid for each cluster we want to make.</br>
* repeat{ </br>
    * Assign each data point to cluster based on the closest centroid.</br>
    * Compute means for each cluster and update centroids.</br>
         }</br>
