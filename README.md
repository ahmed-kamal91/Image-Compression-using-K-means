# Image-Compression-using-K-means
compress image to 16 colors based on Scratched K-means Clustering. 

## why K-mens clustering:
 group unlabeled data into clusters for some business purpose

## How k means clustering work:

assume we have data has 2 features x1, x2 , represented in x and y axis. and neeed to group these poinrs into 3 clusters, so we:
1- randomly taking points values for initialize centroid for each cluster we want to make.
*- repeat { 
              2-Assign each data point to cluster based on the closest centroid.
              3-Compute means for each cluster and update centroids.
          }
